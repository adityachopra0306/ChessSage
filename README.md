# ChessSage: AI-powered Chess Analysis Engine

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analytics platform for Chess.com users. By entering a Chess.com profile, users receive detailed insights about their playing history, performance trends, and personalized recommendations powered by Stockfish analysis and Gemini NLP summarization.

## Status
Website deployed [here](https://chess-sage-neon.vercel.app) through Vercel.
> **Note:** The backend is currently under deployment, see [ChessSage-Backend GitHub](https://github.com/adityachopra0306/ChessSage-backend).  
> However, the repository contains a [Jupyter notebook](notebook/backend.ipynb) with the working backend code, demonstrating the entire analysis pipeline.
